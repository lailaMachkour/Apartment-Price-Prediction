# Apartment-Price-Prediction
#Overview
This project involves scraping apartment data from Avito (a popular online marketplace), performing data cleaning, and building a prediction model to estimate apartment prices. The project is divided into three main parts:

Web Scraping: Extract apartment data from Avito using a custom scraping script.
Data Cleaning: Prepare the raw dataset by handling missing values, formatting data, and feature engineering.
Prediction Model: Apply machine learning techniques to predict apartment prices based on the cleaned dataset.
